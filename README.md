# Youtube-Reviews-Extraction-Sentiment-Analysis
Built an end-to-end Python solution to extract YouTube comments using the YouTube Data API and perform sentiment analysis with NLP techniques. Cleaned and preprocessed unstructured text, classified comments into positive, negative, and neutral categories, and visualized audience sentiment insights.


Detailed Project Description :---

This project provides an automated solution to analyze public opinion by extracting and evaluating user comments from YouTube videos. YouTube is one of the largest platforms where people openly share opinions on movies, products, and services. Manually reading thousands of comments is time-consuming and subjective, so this project converts unstructured comment data into clear, data-driven sentiment insights.

The system uses the YouTube Data API to fetch comments from any public video such as movie trailers, product review videos, or launch events. These comments are then cleaned and preprocessed using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to remove noise such as emojis, URLs, and irrelevant symbols. The processed text is analyzed to determine whether each comment expresses a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.



💡 How This Project Helps

For example, if a user wants to know whether an upcoming movie is likely to be good or bad, they can analyze the comments posted below the movie trailer on YouTube. Instead of relying on a few opinions, this project analyzes hundreds or thousands of comments to summarize overall audience perception. This gives a clearer and more reliable understanding of what people think about the movie before its release.

The same approach can be applied to product review videos. For instance, comments from mobile phone reviews, bike reviews, or camera comparison videos can be analyzed to understand customer satisfaction, common complaints, and positive feedback. This helps potential buyers make informed decisions and helps brands understand consumer sentiment.
